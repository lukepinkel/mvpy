Currently includes rough implementations of 
- Cumulative link models for ordinal regression
- Factor analytic methods
  - Confirmatory factor analysis
  - Exploratory factor analysis
  - Factor rotation
- Linear mixed models capable of handling multivariate models
- Latent variable correlations for handling polychorric, polytomous and tetrachoric correlation
- Partial least squares (soft modeling) techniques
  - Partial least squares covariance
  - Partial least squares regression
  - Partial least squares structural equation modeling
  - Canonical correlation
- Structural equation modeling
- Simple linear model
Although all of these have been tested against results published in the literature, or those obtained in R, they have not been tested systematically, and some of the code is very rough.
